Using Shell Variables:
======================
- A variable is a character string to which we assign a value. The value assigned could be a number, text, filename, device, or any other type of data.
- A variable is nothing more than a pointer to the actual data. The shell enables you to create, assign, and delete variables.

1. Variable Names:
------------------
- The name of a variable can contain only letters (a to z or A to Z), numbers ( 0 to 9) or the underscore character ( _).
Ex: Valid Names
----
. _ALI
. TOKEN_A
. VAR_1
. VAR_2

Ex: Invalid Names:
---
. 2_VAR
. -VARIABLE
. VAR1-VAR2
. VAR_A!

2.Defining Variables: you can define any value in variables.
---------------------
Variables are defined as  " NAME="Zara Ali" "
VAR1="Zara Ali"
VAR2=100

3.Accessing Values:
---------------------
- To access the value stored in a variable, prefix its name with the dollar sign ($):
Ex:
----
#!/bin/sh

NAME="Zara Ali"
echo $NAME

. The above script will produce the following value −
 Zara Ali

4. Unsetting Variable:
---------------------------
- Unsetting or deleting a variable directs the shell to remove the variable from the list of variables 
ex:
---
#!/bin/sh

NAME="Zara Ali"
unset NAME
echo $NAME


5.Variable Types:
------------------
- When a shell is running, three main types of variables are present −

Local Variables − A local variable is a variable that is present within the current instance of the shell. 
                  It is not available to programs that are started by the shell. They are set at the command prompt.

Environment Variables − An environment variable is available to any child process of the shell. 
                        Some programs need environment variables in order to function correctly. 
                        Usually, a shell script defines only those environment variables that are needed by the programs that it runs.

Shell Variables − A shell variable is a special variable that is set by the shell and is required by the shell in order to function correctly. 
                  Some of these variables are environment variables whereas others are local variables.
