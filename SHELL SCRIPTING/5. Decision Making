Decision Making:
================
- we will understand shell decision-making in Unix. While writing a shell script, there may be a situation when you need to adopt one path out of the given two paths. So you need to make use of conditional statements that allow your program to make correct 
  decisions and perform the right actions.- 
- Unix Shell supports conditional statements which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. We will now understand two decision-making statements here −

 The if...else statement
 The case...esac statement
 
 1.The if...else statements:
 -----------------------------
If else statements are useful decision-making statements which can be used to select an option from a given set of options.

Unix Shell supports following forms of if…else statement −

- if...fi statement
- if...else...fi statement
- if...elif...else...fi statement

Example:
---------
Syntax:
---------
if [ <some test> ]
then
<commands>
fi
------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
# Basic if statement
if [ $1 -gt 100 ]
then
echo Hey that\'s a large number.
pwd
fi
date

Example 2: Nested if statements.
-----------
#!/bin/bash
# Nested if statements
if [ $1 -gt 100 ]
then
echo Hey that\'s a large number.
if (( $1 % 2 == 0 ))
then
echo And is also an even number.
fi
fi

Example 3: if then else
----------
#!/bin/bash
# else example
if [ $# -eq 1 ]
then
nl $1
else
nl /dev/stdin
fi

Example 4: If Elif Else
------------
#!/bin/bash
# elif statements
if [ $1 -ge 18 ]
then
echo You may go to the party.
elif [ $2 == 'yes' ]
then
echo You may go to the party but be back before midnight.
else
echo You may not go to the party.
fi

Example 5: using if and operators
------------
#!/bin/bash
# and example
if [ -r $1 ] && [ -s $1 ]
then
echo This file is useful.
fi

#!/bin/bash
# or example
if [ $USER == 'bob' ] || [ $USER == 'andy' ]
then
ls -alh
else
ls
fi

Case Statements:
-----------------
- Sometimes we may wish to take different paths based upon a variable matching a series of patterns.
  We could use a series of if and elif statements but that would soon grow to be unweildly

Examples:
----------
#!/bin/bash
# case example
case $1 in
start)
echo starting
;;
stop)
echo stoping
;;
restart)
echo restarting
;;
*)
echo don\'t know
;;
esac
---------------------
#!/bin/bash
# Print a message about disk useage.
space_free=$( df -h | awk '{ print $5 }' | sort -n | tail -n 1 | sed 's/%//' )
case $space_free in
[1-5]*)
echo Plenty of disk space available
;;
[6-7]*)
echo There could be a problem in the near future
;;
8*)
echo Maybe we should look at clearing out old files
;;
9*)
echo We could have a serious problem on our hands soon
;;
*)
echo Something is not quite right here
;;
esac
